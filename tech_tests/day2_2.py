'''

The pseudo code is something like this ...

read all strings into a list

take a string from the front of the list and compare/process that one with the rest of the strings in the list

compare/process means compare the first char, second char, ...

keep the chars that are the same and create a new string from them

rinse and repeat for all strings

in the list of resulting strings, look for the one that is one shorter than the original string
